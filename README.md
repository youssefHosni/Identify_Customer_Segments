# Identify_Customer_Segments

In this project,  real-life data from Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution were used. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. As a data scientist i will use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, i cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.
